Node.js is a free open source server environment that enables you to run a various platforms like windows,linux,unix, mac os x etc.
Node.js uses JavaScript on the server and an asynchronous programming.

A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.


Node.js handles a file request by:

Sending the task to the computer's file system, after which it is ;
Ready to handle the next request;
When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client;
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.

NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
Node Package Manager(NPM)...helps us install packages and keeps track of the packages we install.

2 ways to install packages...npm install packageName... npm install package --save-dev(to install as a dev dependency)

package.json keeps track of our project ... npm init helps you install package.json or most preferably npm init -y

require files in node... you must export files in order to require them. 
with 1 variable..export the varible// 2 or more export the variable as an object..using module.exports
node modules are the files needed for the package to work
